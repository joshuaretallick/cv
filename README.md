## Joshua Retallick

A highly driven and ambitious junior web developer with an extensive background in event management. I am proud to have graduated in Jan 21 from a highly selective, intensive software development boot-camp.  Makers Academy prides itself on developing juniors of all backgrounds in to ambitious developers with a keen focus on craftsmanship and best practices at its core.   Here I was able to hone my technical and soft skills through communicative problem solving, test driven development and group projects that will help me to integrate seamlessly in to any team.  Prior to my newly found path I was the founder and owner of Old Empire, a successful and respected digital-first live music events company.  Since graduating I have begun working on personal coding projects and studying towards AWS Certification.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[SOS App](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/SOS-App)**            | An app that recognises the users location (worldwide) and tells them the emergency services number for their location plus directions to the nearest emergency services. | SwiftUI, Swift UIKit, XCode, Google Maps/Places, Core Location. |
| **[Dear Diary](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/dear-diary)**            | This blogging app has been created without generating any scaffolds or the usual Rails helpers. So all routes, models, views and controllers were manually coded by myself which has helped me really delve in to the magic beneath the hood. | Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Mini-Test, JQuery, Bootstrap, Popper, BCrypt. |
| **[MessageMe](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/message_me)**            | For this app I wanted to expand on my knowledge of Rails but with a single page app and exploring new features like ActionCable & Semantic UI | Ruby, Ruby On Rails, ActionCable, Semantic UI, CoffeeScript, JavaScript, JQuery, BCrypt. |
| **[Dogbook](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/dogbook)** | A facebook style clone written on the Ruby On Rails framework that allows connections for man's best friend. | Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Capybara, RSpec. |
| **[MakersBnB](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/makersbnb)** | My first entry in to app building via an AirBnB clone.  This is a pretty primitive example but I think it is important to include to compare how far my learning has come since I began coding. | Ruby, Sinatra, Capybara, RSpec. |

#### Process Review Example

Over the past few months I have undertaken regular reviews of my problem solving process. You can see an example of the feedback I have received here: **[Review](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0tdcp531x5ysogz/2021-01-12-Orange%20Pidgeot%2069-feedback.pdf?dl=0)**

#### Creative

As a promoter I have learned to be creative in my problem-solving and try to look sideways when something seems intractable.

#### Inquisitive

I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship.

#### Enthusiastic

I am highly motivated and unafraid of a challenge. I do not shy away from difficult or time consuming tasks.

#### Team-player

Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for knuckling down and getting my hands dirty or offering leadership when the situation arises.
